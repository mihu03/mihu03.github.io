    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial intelligence (AI) is now one of the most popular and fundamental areas, and has found its practical applications in many fields, such as autonomous and robotic systems, manufacturing systems, cyber-physical systems, communication systems, image and pattern recognitions, etc. AI has been extensively studied in the past decades. There is no doubt that AI has been and will continue playing a big role in our daily life and real world applications. This talk will present some challenges facing to AI, and issues in cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;
